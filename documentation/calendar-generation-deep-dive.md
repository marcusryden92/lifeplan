# Calendar Generation — Deep Dive

This document describes the `utils/calendar-generation/` engine: the code that turns the user's planners, templates, and previously persisted calendar into a fresh `{ events, categoryEvents, travelEvents, plannerScores, messages }` payload on every regeneration.

The engine is a stateful pipeline. Read top-to-bottom; later sections assume the data structures and phase ordering established earlier.

> Scope. This is engine-only. Cross-cutting models that feed the engine (`Planner`, `EventTemplate`, `Category`, `Location`, `TravelTime`) are referenced where relevant but defined in `prisma/schemas/models/`.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview

`generateCalendar(...)` is a single-shot, deterministic transformation:

```
inputs:
  userId, weekStartDay,
  templates:       EventTemplate[]         (recurring weekly blocks)
  planners:        Planner[]               (tasks, goals, plans, etc.)
  previousCalendar:SimpleEvent[]           (so we can preserve memoized past)
  options:         GenerateCalendarOptions (travel matrix, categories, ...)

output:
  events:         SimpleEvent[]              // plans, scheduled tasks, completed, memoized
  categoryEvents: CategoryEvent[]            // materialized weekly category occurrences
  travelEvents:   TravelEvent[]              // travel blocks between scheduled items
  plannerScores:  Record<string, number>     // per-planner urgency scores (ephemeral, not persisted)
  messages:       EngineMessage[]            // engine console rows (failures, warnings, SCHEDULED_OK)
```

The pipeline is built on three central data structures:

- **The slot array** — a single mutable, time-sorted array (`TimeSlotManager.slots`) holding every minute of the scheduling horizon as a sealed union: `AvailableSlot | OccupiedSlot | CategorySlot | TravelSlot`.
- **The static-pass state machine** — walks the slot array in order and decides where to place travel between consecutive non-matching locations. Runs once preliminarily, then again at the seam after every incremental expansion.
- **The dynamic scheduler** — iterates priority-sorted candidate tasks/goals, scores remaining placeable slots, and reserves them (along with inbound/outbound travel) via splice.

The horizon is **bounded** (28 days initially, see [constants.ts:80](../utils/calendar-generation/constants.ts#L80)). As the scheduler runs out of room, [expandSlots](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/expandSlots.ts) appends another chunk from a marked pickup point. A single Plan a year out no longer balloons the initial slot array.

## 2. Public Surface

### Entry point

[utils/calendar-generation/calendarGeneration.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/calendarGeneration.ts) exports `generateCalendar(userId, weekStartDay, templates, planners, prevCalendar, options)`. It is a thin wrapper that:

1. Normalizes the optional `bufferTimeMinutes`-as-number legacy arg into a `GenerateCalendarOptions` object.
2. Builds a `LoggingConfig` from local flags (see [Debugging](#13-debugging-the-engine)).
3. Constructs `new CalendarGenerator(weekStartDay, input).generate()` and returns the resulting `{ events, categoryEvents, travelEvents, plannerScores, messages }`.

### Module exports

[index.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/index.ts) re-exports the public surface: `generateCalendar`, the core classes (`CalendarGenerator`, `TimeSlotManager`, `Scheduler`), the strategy interface + built-ins, the model types (`TimeSlot` union, `SchedulingResult`, `SchedulingContext`, `SchedulingFailure`, etc.), the `dateTimeService`, the validation helpers, and the shard-model utilities from `timeSlotUtils`.

### Tunable constants

All scheduling knobs live in [constants.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/constants.ts). The key ones:

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.HORIZON_CHUNK_DAYS` | 28 | Days the initial slot build covers; each expansion appends another chunk of this size. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.LOW_SLOT_WATERMARK` | 100 | When the slot array has fewer Available slots than this, the scheduler triggers proactive expansion before the next placement attempt. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.PLACEMENT_BUFFER_DAYS` | 3 | Tail buffer at the trailing edge of the horizon where dynamic placement is suppressed. Leaves room for the next expansion's static-pass resume. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.MAX_DAYS_TO_SEARCH` | 90 | Hard cap on how far ahead the slot finder will look. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.MAX_WEEKS_TO_SEARCH` | 12 | Cap on expansion iterations in the outer scheduler loop. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.MAX_ITERATIONS` | 10000 | Safety net against infinite loops. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.MIN_SLOT_SIZE` | 5 | Smallest slot the geometry helpers will preserve. |
| `SCHEDULING_CONFIG.ADJACENT_TRAVEL_TOLERANCE_MS` | 10 min | Slack for matching adjacent travel slots (used by `findAdjacentTravel*`). |
| `SchedulingFailureReason` | enum | `TOO_LARGE`, `NO_SLOTS`, `ITERATION_LIMIT`, `DEPENDENCY_CONFLICT`, `INVALID_TASK`, `TEMPLATE_ERROR`. |

Strategy weights and scoring values live separately in [strategies/defaultStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/strategies/defaultStrategy.ts) (covered in [Section 10](#10-strategies)).

## 3. Models

### The TimeSlot Union

[models/TimeSlot.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/models/TimeSlot.ts) defines the sealed union that flows through the entire pipeline:

```
Slot = AvailableSlot | OccupiedSlot | CategorySlot | TravelSlot

AvailableSlot   { type:"available",  start, end, durationMinutes,
                  prevLocationId?, nextLocationId? }

OccupiedSlot    { type:"occupied",   start, end, durationMinutes,
                  eventId, plannerType, eventType, locationId? }

CategorySlot    { type:"category",   start, end, durationMinutes,
                  categoryId, isStrictCategory,
                  currentLocationId, prevLocationId, nextLocationId,
                  trespassingStart?, trespassingEnd?,
                  isFinal? }

TravelSlot      { type:"travel",     start, end, durationMinutes,
                  eventId, eventType:"travel",
                  travelFromLocationId, travelToLocationId,
                  travelType: "preliminary" | "inbound" | "outbound",
                  insufficientTravel,                  // red marker
                  overconstrained?,                    // yellow marker
                  requiredTravelMinutes,
                  consumedCategoryIds?,
                  // --- shard model ---
                  travelId?,
                  originalType?: "available" | "category",
                  originalSourceStart?, originalSourceEnd?,
                  originalCategoryId?, originalLocationId?,
                  originalIsStrictCategory?,
                  originalPrevLocationId?, originalNextLocationId? }
```

A few invariants worth internalizing:

- `locationId === null` on Occupied means **"Anywhere"**. Travel decisions propagate *through* an Anywhere event rather than ending at it.
- `AvailableSlot.prevLocationId` / `nextLocationId` represent the location the user is at when the gap begins / ends. They are the only thing the static pass needs to decide whether and where travel goes.
- `CategorySlot.currentLocationId` is the category's own location (the user is *at* the category's location during the interior). `prevLocationId` / `nextLocationId` describe the surrounding context.
- `isFinal` is a single-instance pickup marker for incremental expansion; at most one slot in the array carries it (see [Section 8](#8-incremental-horizon-expansion)).
- `PlaceableSlot = AvailableSlot | CategorySlot` — strategies only score, and dynamic tasks only land in, one of these two.

### Scheduling Models

[models/SchedulingModels.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/models/SchedulingModels.ts) carries the shape contracts between phases:

- `CalendarGenerationInput` — the typed input to `CalendarGenerator`, including `previousEngineMessages` which the message emitter consults to carry the user-owned `dismissed` flag forward by id.
- `CalendarGenerationResult` extends `SchedulingResult` with `categoryEvents`, `travelEvents`, `plannerScores`, and `messages` (the orchestrator's full output).
- `SchedulingContext` — the bag of state passed to every scheduling call: `currentDate`, `weekStartDay`, `allPlanners`, `scheduledEvents`, `metrics`, `categories` (Map), `plannerLocationMap`, `plannerCategoryMap`, `categoryEligibilityMap`, `plannerConstraintsMap` (per-item earliest-start / allowed-times, resolved down the tree), `previousCalendarById` (identity reuse for stable regens), the optional `schedulerRecorder`, and the per-iteration `placementCutoffDate` (tail buffer).
- `SlotSelectionResult` — what `selectBestSlot` hands to `reserveTaskSlot`. Crucially carries `absorbableTravel` and `reclaimPrecedingGapTravel` as `TravelShardSpan | null`, so removal is by identity (`travelId`), not heuristic time search. Also carries `grantedDurationMinutes` — the minutes the reservation will actually occupy (`task.duration` for plain placements; what `ChunkSizing.grant` returned for chunked ones).
- `ChunkSizing` — dynamic sizing for chunked placement (split tasks, goal day caps): `{ minMinutes, grant(headroomMinutes, dayBudgetMinutes), dayBudget?(slotStart) }`. When passed to `scheduleTask`, slots are fit-tested at `minMinutes` and `grant` decides the reserved duration from the selected slot's real headroom — chunk sizes derive from calendar geometry, not a fixed block size. See [Section 6](#6-the-dynamic-scheduling-pipeline).
- `SchedulingFailure` — `{ taskId, taskTitle, reason: SchedulingFailureReason, details, context? }`.

### Template Models

[models/TemplateModels.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/models/TemplateModels.ts) defines `PerTemplateMask` — the normalized form templates take after expansion. `endMinutes` may exceed 1440 for midnight-crossing templates; downstream helpers handle the wrap.

## 4. The 12 Phases (CalendarGenerator)

[core/CalendarGenerator.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/core/CalendarGenerator.ts) is the orchestrator. Each phase delegates to a single function in [helpers/CalendarGenerator/](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/).

### Phase 1 — Validate input

[validateInput.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/validateInput.ts) runs `validateGenerationInput` from the [CalendarValidator](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarValidator/) module. On failure, returns immediately with `success: false` and empty arrays. Validation covers required fields (`userId`, `weekStartDay 0–6`), per-planner constraints (duration > 0 unless goal, `duration ≤ MINUTES_PER_WEEK`, valid deadline), per-template constraints (`startDay 0–6`, `startTime "HH:MM"`, `duration ≤ MINUTES_PER_DAY`), and same-day template conflict detection. A start-less plan is a *warning*, not an error — `buildPlanEvents` null-guards it, so a triaged-but-timeless plan doesn't blank the calendar.

### Phase 2 — Build initial event array

[buildInitialEventArray.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildInitialEventArray.ts) combines three sources into a single `eventArray`:

1. **Memoized events** ([buildMemoizedEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/buildMemoizedEvents.ts)) — items from `previousCalendar` whose end is before `now` and aren't templates/travel/category wrappers **or plans**. Preserved verbatim. Plans are excluded because they are deterministic from their own planner row — pinning the old emit would make the engine ignore a `starts` change on any plan whose block already ended. Split planners are excluded for the same reason: their frozen past is the completed-segment list on the row (re-emitted fresh by `buildCompletedEvents`), and an uncompleted past chunk must vanish so its minutes reschedule instead of freezing as if they happened.
2. **Plan events** ([buildPlanEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/buildPlanEvents.ts)) — `Planner` rows with `plannerType: "plan"` and a `starts` timestamp, converted to `SimpleEvent` shape. Completion doesn't apply to plans: completion times on a plan row are ignored and the plan always renders at its `starts` anchor. Recurring plans (non-null `Planner.recurrence`) expand into one concrete event per occurrence via [expandPlanOccurrences](../utils/planRecurrence.ts), bounded to `currentDate + PLAN_RECURRENCE_WINDOW_DAYS` (and the rule's `until` / `MAX_PLAN_OCCURRENCES`), with deterministic composite ids `` `${planId}|${localStartKey}` `` so idle regens diff empty. Per-occurrence exceptions on the row (`recurrenceExceptions`) are applied during expansion: `deleted` occurrences are skipped, `moved` ones keep their original key but start at the override time. Occurrence events carry `plannerType: "plan"`, so they are excluded from memoization like plain plans; any engine site resolving a planner from an event id must use `plannerIdFromEventId` (slot location lookups, trespass marking, and SCHEDULED_LATE emission already do).
3. **Completed events** ([buildCompletedEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/buildCompletedEvents.ts)) — tasks/goals with `completedStartTime`/`completedEndTime` set, rendered at their actual completion window (not the originally-scheduled window). Plans are excluded — they are fixed-time anchors, not completable items. Split tasks are segment-driven: each entry in `Planner.completedSegments` renders as its own frozen event with id `` `${plannerId}|done:${segmentStart}` `` (`completedSegmentEventId`), re-derived from the row each regen; the classic completion-window path applies only when a split task has no segments (explicitly completed before any chunk was).

Returns `{ eventArray, memoizedEventIds, previousById }`. The ID set is used downstream to prevent the scheduler from re-scheduling already-frozen rows. `previousById` (previous emits keyed by id) rides into the scheduling context; every event builder passes its candidate through [stabilizeEvent](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/stabilizeEvent.ts), which reuses the previous emit's `extendedProps.id` / `createdAt` and returns the previous object outright when nothing meaningful changed — an unchanged placement must diff as a no-op, not a fresh-uuid phantom update (see [`stable-regen.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/stable-regen.test.ts)).

### Phase 3 — Expand templates

[expandTemplates.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/expandTemplates.ts) wraps the [TemplateExpander](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TemplateExpander/) module:

- `expandTemplates` materializes each `EventTemplate` into recurring `SimpleEvent` blocks across the horizon.
- `getPerTemplateMasks` produces `PerTemplateMask[]` (one mask per day-of-week occurrence) — the normalized form the slot builder consumes.
- `calculateLargestGap` computes the single largest contiguous gap in a clean week. Used by old `TOO_LARGE` heuristics; see [capacityCheck](#9-capacity-gating--placement-buffer) for the current, more accurate gate.
- `gapIntervalsForDay` returns the unoccupied intervals for any specific day, accounting for midnight-crossing templates via `endDayOffset`.

Returns `{ filteredEvents, recurringTemplateEvents, perTemplateMasks, largestTemplateGap, updatedMetrics }`.

### Phase 4 — Build location and category maps

Four read-only derivations computed before any slot work:

- [buildLocationMap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildLocationMap.ts) wraps [LocationMapper/buildLocationMap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/LocationMapper/buildLocationMap.ts). Resolution order per planner: **(1)** own `locationId` (unless `useParentLocation`), **(2)** ancestor chain via `parentId`, **(3)** the planner's effective category's `locationId`.
- [buildPlannerCategoryMap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildPlannerCategoryMap.ts) resolves each planner's effective categoryId by walking the parent chain, with memoization (O(n) overall even for deep trees).
- [buildCategoryEligibilityMap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildCategoryEligibilityMap.ts) resolves each category to the set of category ids whose windows its items may occupy (itself + non-confined ancestors, up to a `confineToOwnWindows` ceiling). Built off the full category list — the chain walks through classification-only ancestors. See [Section 12](#12-category-system) for how the match sites consume it.
- [buildPlannerConstraintsMap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildPlannerConstraintsMap.ts) resolves each planner's scheduling constraints (`earliestStartDate`, `allowedTimes`) down the tree: earliest = latest date in the chain, allowed = the chain of settings objects (intersected interval-wise at placement time — settings-level algebra would need day-set × range-set intersection for no gain). Plans are excluded (fixed anchors). Rides `SchedulingContext.plannerConstraintsMap`; parse/interval helpers live in [utils/allowedTimes.ts](../../utils/allowedTimes.ts).

### Phase 5 — Filter scheduled categories

Inside the `CalendarGenerator` constructor, `input.categories` is filtered down to those that both **opt in** via `useTimeWindows: true` **and** have at least one window in `timeSlots`. This `scheduledCategories` list is what constrains slot geometry and the static pass; categories that don't meet both conditions still contribute location inheritance via the planner location map, but their windows and strictness do not affect scheduling.

### Phase 6 — Build slots + run preliminary travel pass

This is the most consequential phase. It happens in three sub-steps:

**6a. Build available slots.** [buildAvailableSlots](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/buildAvailableSlots.ts) produces the initial slot array covering `[today, today + HORIZON_CHUNK_DAYS]`:

1. Filter events/templates inside the horizon.
2. [inheritLocationFromCategoryPeriods](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/inheritLocationFromCategoryPeriods.ts) — for any Occupied interval fully inside a category period that has a location, stamp the category's location onto the interval so subsequent splits propagate location through it.
3. Find gaps between Occupied intervals → `AvailableSlot[]`.
4. [splitSlotsAtCategoryBoundaries](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/splitSlotsAtCategoryBoundaries.ts) — slice Available slots wherever a category period begins or ends. Inside a category window the fragment becomes a `CategorySlot`; outside it remains `AvailableSlot`. An entry-location cursor threads each split's `prevLocationId` / `nextLocationId`. Periods arrive pre-expanded (and exception-adjusted) from [expandCategoryWindowPeriods](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/expandCategoryWindowPeriods.ts), computed once per `buildAvailableSlots` call and shared with `inheritLocationFromCategoryPeriods`.
5. Propagate "Anywhere" locations forward (`prevLocationId`) and backward (`nextLocationId`) through the array, so a gap surrounded by located events inherits both ends.
6. Sort the unified slot array by start time.

**6b. Static travel pass.** `timeSlotManager.slots = [...builtSlots]`, then [staticEventTravelPass](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/staticEventTravelPass.ts) runs. See [Section 7](#7-the-static-travel-pass).

**6c. Drop past Available slots.** [dropPastAvailableSlots](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/dropPastAvailableSlots.ts) removes Available gaps ending at or before `currentDate`. Past Travel, Occupied, and Category slots remain (for memoized rendering).

### Phase 7 — Build the dynamic scheduling recorder

[SchedulerRecorder](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/SchedulerRecorder.ts) is constructed with the same filter pattern as `TravelPassRecorder`: off unless `enableLogging && logging.dynamicScheduling`, optionally scoped to `[dateRangeStart, dateRangeEnd]`. Every `scheduleTask` call appends a record.

### Phase 8 — Prepare scheduling context

[prepareSchedulingContext.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/prepareSchedulingContext.ts) packs everything into a single `SchedulingContext` object: current date, week start, planners, scheduled events, metrics, the `Category` lookup map, all four Phase 4 maps (planner→location, planner→category, category eligibility, planner constraints), `previousCalendarById` (identity reuse for stable regens), and the scheduler recorder.

### Phase 9 — Prepare candidates

Urgency scoring runs once at the top of `CalendarGenerator.execute()` — before validation, before this phase — via [scoreCandidatesAndRootGoals](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/PrioritySorter/sortByPriorityAndConstraints.ts). The pass covers scheduling candidates (standalone tasks + ready root goals) **plus every top-level uncompleted goal**, so consumers like the dashboard can rank goals the scheduler intentionally skipped (e.g. not-yet-ready ones) using the same denominator (sum of all planner durations). The resulting map is returned in `plannerScores` and passed into this phase.

Scoring itself: tasks without a deadline get `MIN_URGENCY_MULTIPLIER * priority`; tasks with a deadline use a sigmoid over deadline proximity (parameters in `URGENCY_CONFIG`: `CURVE_STEEPNESS: 4`, `CRITICAL_THRESHOLD: 0.7`, scaled into `[URGENCY_SCALE_MIN, URGENCY_SCALE_MAX] = [0.3, 1.0]`).

[prepareCandidates.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/prepareCandidates.ts) returns the ordered list of planners the scheduler will try:

- Excludes memoized rows.
- Excludes completed tasks — completed items render via `buildCompletedEvents` (Phase 2) and must never re-enter scheduling.
- Keeps ready root goals (`isReady === true`), plus **ready** tasks whose root ancestor is **not** a goal (standalone tasks and task-rooted subtrees). Readiness is the universal gate: a task also needs `isReady === true` to become a candidate (tasks/plans default ready on create, so this is transparent for the common case; a user or the assistant can hold a task off the calendar by un-readying it). Tasks inside a goal subtree are owned by the goal's readiness gate instead — `scheduleGoal` places them when the root is ready, and an unready goal's subtree stays off the calendar entirely; they are excluded here regardless of their own flag (they inherit the root's readiness via the cascade). Admitting goal-subtree tasks individually would make readying a no-op.
- Sorts via [sortByPriorityAndConstraints](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/PrioritySorter/sortByPriorityAndConstraints.ts) — two-tier sort: category-constrained items first (because they have fewer eligible slots), then by descending **urgency score** looked up from the precomputed map. Urgency is not a strategy; it is decided here before any slot scoring.

### Phase 10 — Schedule tasks and goals

Constructs `new Scheduler(timeSlotManager, travelManager, strategy, context)` and calls `scheduleTasksAndGoals(...)`. See [Section 8](#8-incremental-horizon-expansion) for the outer loop; see [Section 6](#6-the-dynamic-scheduling-pipeline) for the per-task pipeline. Besides events and failures, the call returns the constraint-compromise records accumulated during placement (`splitRelaxations`, `goalCapRelaxations`) — Phase 12 turns them into engine messages.

### Phase 11 — Assemble final events

[assembleFinalEvents.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/assembleFinalEvents.ts) produces three of the output arrays (a fourth output, `plannerScores`, comes from the Phase 9 scoring pass — see above; a fifth, `messages`, comes from Phase 12 — see below):

- **`events`** — memoized + plan + completed + scheduled tasks + templates, with trespass flags stamped via [markTrespassingEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/markTrespassingEvents.ts) and template events filtered out at the end via [assembleFinalEventList](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/assembleFinalEventList.ts).
- **`categoryEvents`** — [buildCategoryEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/buildCategoryEvents.ts) materializes one `CategoryEvent` per `CategoryTimeWindow` per matching day across the horizon. IDs are composite: `` `${categoryTimeWindowId}|${YYYY-MM-DD-local}` ``. [stampCategoryEventBorders](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/stampCategoryEventBorders.ts) propagates `trespassingStart` / `trespassingEnd` flags from category slots and insufficient-travel slots onto the persisted rows.
- **`travelEvents`** — [generateTravelEvents](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/generateTravelEvents.ts) merges contiguous shards of each logical travel back into a single `TravelEvent`, keyed by `travelId`.

The horizon for category wrapper expansion is re-derived from the final slot array via [deriveSchedulingHorizon](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/deriveSchedulingHorizon.ts); the latest slot's end is used, so wrappers extend with any expanded chunks.

### Phase 12 — Emit engine messages

[coalesceMessages.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/coalesceMessages.ts) (`buildEngineMessages`) reads the Phase 10 failure list plus the Phase 11 output (finalized events + travel events) and produces the persisted `EngineMessage[]` array the console renders. Each per-type emitter writes rows already keyed by their identity tuple, so there is no post-hoc fold:

- **`TASK_TOO_LARGE`** — one row per planner that failed with `TOO_LARGE`. Payload carries `{ duration, maxCapacity }` (structured — the renderer builds the body).
- **`TASK_UNSCHEDULABLE`** — one row per (plannerId, reason) for every non-`TOO_LARGE` failure. Payload carries `reason` only; prose lives in [renderEngineMessage.ts](../utils/renderEngineMessage.ts) so a copy rewrite doesn't require a data migration.
- **`SCHEDULED_LATE`** — one row per placed planner event whose scheduled start is after the deadline inherited via parent walk, guarded so completed tasks and not-yet-passed deadlines don't emit.
- **`INSUFFICIENT_TRAVEL`** — coalesces recurring travel legs by `(from, to, actualMinutes, timeOfDay, dayOfWeek)`; 400 repeats of the same short leg fold to one row with `affectedCount`.
- **`SPLIT_CONSTRAINT_RELAXED`** — one warn-tone row per (plannerId, kind) from Phase 10's `splitRelaxations`: `maxChunk` = the carving rule forced a chunk beyond `maxMinutes` (a remainder under `2*min` can only place whole), `dayCap` = the final compromise pass placed chunks past the task's per-day cap rather than dropping the minutes. N compromised chunks fold into one row carrying `affectedCount` + `totalMinutes`; both ride in the id, so a changed compromise supersedes the prior (possibly dismissed) row while an identical regen diffs empty.
- **`GOAL_DAY_CAP_RELAXED`** — same shape per (goalId, kind) from `goalCapRelaxations`: `oversizedLeaf` = a single block (or a split leaf's minimum chunk) is bigger than the goal's daily cap and placed whole, `dayCap` = the final compromise pass exceeded the cap. `capMinutes` is an emit-time fact excluded from the id (like `TASK_TOO_LARGE.maxCapacity`) — a cap edit alone doesn't resurface a dismissed row; a changed compromise does.
- **`SCHEDULED_OK`** — one info-tone row per regen with `placedCount` in the id, so a change in count supersedes the prior card. Skipped when count is zero.

The emit array is deduped by id (keep-first) before diffing — id is the DB primary key, so duplicate ids in one array would double-create in the sync transaction (the known producer: a never-scheduled task failing once per expansion pass).

Dismissal is user-owned. `buildDismissedSet(previousEngineMessages)` extracts every id whose prior row had `dismissed: true`; when the current emit produces the same id, the flag is carried forward. A fresh id (situation shifted) surfaces as a new, undismissed row. Full identity model and payload shapes live in [models/EngineMessage.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/models/EngineMessage.ts).

The `createdAt` / `updatedAt` fields are left empty on emit — the DB owns them, and `compareCalendarData` strips both sides before comparing so the placeholders don't mark rows spuriously changed.

## 5. Slot Building & Geometry

### Single mutable array

[TimeSlotManager](../utils/calendar-generation/core/TimeSlotManager.ts) is intentionally thin (~22 lines). Its only job is to hold the canonical `slots: Slot[]` array, sorted by start time. All geometry helpers operate on this array directly via `splice`. There is no per-day bucketing; filter by `slot.type` for kind-specific views.

### Buffer model for dynamic placement

The buffer rule is "**each unit owns its own leading and trailing buffer; travel sits flush against the task**". Inside a slot a dynamic placement looks like:

```
[slot.start] [leading buffer] [travel-before] [task] [travel-after] [trailing buffer] [slot.end]
```

Three special cases:

- If `selectBestSlot` discovers travel-before fits **standalone** in an earlier slot (via [canPlaceStandaloneTravelBefore](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/canPlaceStandaloneTravelBefore.ts)), the task lands flush at `slot.start` — the standalone travel's end becomes the leading boundary and the earlier slot owns the buffer.
- If no travel-before is needed, the leading buffer still applies.
- Leftover slots after splicing are created flush with the unit's edges (no `+bufferMs` offset). The recursive "each placement owns its own buffer" rule yields exactly one buffer of separation between consecutive dynamic placements in the same slot, with no double-counting.

Static placements (plans, templates, category-wrapper travel) are always flush with their owning event; the buffer model only applies to dynamic tasks.

### Geometry helpers

[helpers/TimeSlotManager/](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TimeSlotManager/):

- `buildAvailableSlots` — initial 28-day slot build (see Phase 6a). Accepts a `startingLocationOverride` used at expansion seams.
- `expandCategoryWindowPeriods` — THE window-occurrence expansion: every window of the given categories resolved to concrete `CategoryWindowPeriod`s over a range, with per-occurrence exceptions (`CategoryTimeWindow.recurrenceExceptions`) applied — deleted occurrences vacated, moved ones re-emitted at their override with `originalStart` preserved. Moved occurrences are emitted by the range that CONTAINS the override, not the range iterating the original day (same containing-range rule as template `masksToIntervals` — chunked expansion would otherwise drop or duplicate a cross-seam move). Shared by the slot fabric (`splitSlotsAtCategoryBoundaries`, `inheritLocationFromCategoryPeriods`), CategoryEvent materialization (`buildCategoryEvents`), and wrapper recovery (`findCategoryWrapper`), so they cannot disagree on which occurrences exist. Capacity heuristics stay exception-unaware by design.
- `splitSlotsAtCategoryBoundaries` — carve Available at pre-expanded category period edges; outside-fragments stay Available, inside-fragments become CategorySlots; threads entry-location across fragments.
- `inheritLocationFromCategoryPeriods` — stamp period locations onto Occupied intervals fully inside pre-expanded window periods.
- `expandSlotForDay` — resolve a single `CategoryTimeWindow` rule to concrete bounds for a given day, exception-unaware. Handles overnight slots by adding 24h when `endTime ≤ startTime`. Used by `expandCategoryWindowPeriods` and the clean-week capacity heuristics.
- `findAllFittingSlots` — return all `PlaceableSlot[]` where the placement's fit-test size (`task.duration`, or `ChunkSizing.minMinutes` for chunked placements) plus buffer fits, respecting the task's eligible window-category set (own category + non-confined ancestors) and the per-iteration `placementCutoffDate`. Strict categories the task is not eligible for are filtered out for uncategorized tasks too. Candidates are copies clipped to `afterDate`; when the task carries an allowed-times chain, each candidate is further clipped into the sub-fragments satisfying every settings object (one slot can yield several fragments), so the whole placement unit lands inside an allowed window.
- `reserveSlotWithTravel` — atomic placement: removes any absorbed/reclaimed travel shards by `travelId`, splices in `[travel-before?, task, travel-after?]`, and reconstructs leftover Available/Category fragments via [restoreAbsorbedRange](../utils/calendar-generation/utils/timeSlotUtils.ts).
- `dropPastAvailableSlots` — strip Available slots ending ≤ `now`.
- `deriveSchedulingHorizon` — return the latest end across all slots (or a fallback). Used for category-wrapper materialization so expansion extends the wrappers too.
- `getDayAvailableMinutes` / `getDaySlots` — sum or list placeable slots overlapping a given day.

## 6. The Dynamic Scheduling Pipeline

[helpers/Scheduler/](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/) implements a 5-phase per-task pipeline plus loop drivers.

### Per-task pipeline (`scheduleTask`)

[scheduleTask.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/scheduleTask.ts) runs the following for each candidate. The call optionally takes a `ChunkSizing` (split-task chunks, goal-day-cap placements): phase 2 then fit-tests slots at `sizing.minMinutes` instead of `task.duration`, phase 3 skips slots whose remaining day budget is below the minimum and asks `sizing.grant(headroom, dayBudget)` for the actual reserved minutes (returning 0 rejects the slot), and phase 4 reserves `grantedDurationMinutes` rather than the full duration.

1. **`validateTask`** — `task.duration > 0`. On fail: `INVALID_TASK`.
2. **`findValidSlots`** — resolves the task's effective location (`plannerLocationMap`) and category (`plannerCategoryMap` or `task.categoryId`), derives the eligible window-category set (`categoryEligibilityMap`), then calls `findAllFittingSlots`. The task is window-constrained only when that set intersects the window-bearing categories; otherwise it schedules in free time. Scheduling constraints (`plannerConstraintsMap`) are applied here: the effective earliest-start date rides the same `afterTime` seam goal-leaf chaining uses (max of the two), and the allowed-times chain is passed through for slot fragmentation. Returns `{ validSlots, fittingSlots, taskLocationId, constraintForTask }`. On empty: `NO_SLOTS`.
3. **`selectBestSlot`** — scores valid slots via the strategy, then walks candidates in descending score order. For each, computes travel-before / travel-after, inspects whether prior travel can be **absorbed** ([findAdjacentTravelFrom](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/findAdjacentTravels.ts)) or a **preceding-gap return trip** can be **reclaimed** ([findPrecedingGapTravel](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/findAdjacentTravels.ts)), and tests whether the effective slot capacity (extended over absorbable/reclaimable spans) can fit `requiredInside`. Both absorb and reclaim are skipped for tasks with scheduling constraints (`plannerConstraintsMap`) — they back-extend the placement before the candidate's clipped start (see [Section 16](#16-key-gotchas--edge-cases)). Accepts the first slot that fits. Returns a `SlotSelectionResult` carrying any `absorbableTravel: TravelShardSpan | null` and `reclaimPrecedingGapTravel: TravelShardSpan | null`.
4. **`reserveTaskSlot`** — computes the actual `taskStart` / `taskEnd` (accounting for buffer offset, standalone-before placement, and slot-start vs slot-interior position), opportunistically reserves a standalone travel-before if available, then calls `reserveSlotWithTravel` to perform the atomic splice. Absorb / reclaim shard removal is by `travelId` (no time-window search).
5. **`buildTaskEvent`** — constructs the `SimpleEvent`. If the placement falls inside a category window, the category's wrapper ID is attached for renderer grouping. Appends to `context.scheduledEvents` so subsequent placements see it.

### Outer loop (`scheduleTasksAndGoals`)

[scheduleTasksAndGoals.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/scheduleTasksAndGoals.ts) drives candidates to convergence. Two pieces of bookkeeping are created once per run and shared across iterations: `SplitPlacementState` (per-task placed minutes, chunk ordinals, per-day ledgers — so a partially placed split task resumes from its remainder after horizon expansion instead of restarting) and `GoalCapState` (per-goal daily-cap ledgers, for the same reason).

- Per iteration: compute `placementCutoffDate = lastPlaceableSlotEnd − PLACEMENT_BUFFER_DAYS`.
- **Proactive expansion check**: count Available slots. Trigger [expandSlots](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/expandSlots.ts) if either:
  - `availableCount < LOW_SLOT_WATERMARK`, **or**
  - The largest compatible slot for the biggest remaining candidate is smaller than that candidate's **effective duration** ([largestCompatibleSlotForLargestTask](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/capacityCheck.ts)). Effective duration (`effectiveCandidateDuration`) is the item's own duration for tasks (a split item sizes as its required minimum chunk), but for goals it is the **largest uncompleted leaf** — `scheduleGoal` places leaves one at a time, so the subtree aggregate is the wrong unit. Comparing the aggregate here made the watermark permanently true for any substantial ready goal, and the loop burned its whole expansion budget on `continue`s without attempting a single placement.
  - Then `continue` (skip the forward pass and re-check on the expanded array).
- **Forward pass**: walk candidates **in sorted order** (category-constrained and highest-urgency first — matching the Phase 9 sort), calling [scheduleSingleTask](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/scheduleSingleTask.ts) for tasks and [scheduleGoal](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/scheduleGoal.ts) for goals. `scheduleSingleTask` gates `TOO_LARGE` at the task's required block (its full duration, or the required minimum chunk for a split task) and dispatches split tasks to the chunk loop ([Split tasks](#split-tasks-chunked-placement) below); a partially placed split task keeps its chunks on the calendar and stays a candidate, resuming from the remainder next iteration. Resolved ids (scheduled or permanently failed) are collected during the walk and removed after the pass; rows that failed with `NO_SLOTS` are retained for retry. (The old reverse-index splice idiom handed first pick to the lowest-urgency item under contention, inverting the sorter's intent.)
- **Reactive backstop**: if candidates remain after a full forward pass, run `expandSlots` and loop again.
- Stops when candidates empty or `expansionsDone ≥ MAX_WEEKS_TO_SEARCH`.
- **Final compromise pass**: with the expansion budget spent and candidates still standing, one last walk runs with `allowDayCapRelaxation: true` — placing a chunk past the split task's or goal's per-day cap beats dropping the minutes entirely. Scarcity stays strict through every normal pass so expansion gets the chance to satisfy the caps before they're violated. Every compromise is recorded (`SplitPlacementState.relaxations` / `GoalCapState.relaxations`) and surfaced by Phase 12 as `SPLIT_CONSTRAINT_RELAXED` / `GOAL_DAY_CAP_RELAXED`. Non-split candidates get one last ordinary attempt, which is harmless.
- Candidates still standing after the compromise pass each push a `NO_SLOTS` failure — this exit used to be silent, which let a starved run report `SCHEDULED_OK` with zero events while the diff sync deleted every previously placed event. Failures for tasks that eventually placed on a later iteration are dropped at the end (a `NO_SLOTS` on attempt 1 that succeeds after expansion is not console-worthy).

### Goals

`scheduleGoal` resolves the goal's bottom-layer uncompleted tasks (via `getSortedTreeBottomLayer`), filters out completed / already-scheduled / memoized tasks, and schedules each in sequence using `goalAfterTime = previousTaskEnd` so the goal's children stay temporally clustered. Each leaf is gated `TOO_LARGE` at its own required block (full duration, or minimum chunk for a split leaf) against `min(maxEffectiveCapacityFor, maxAllowedBlockMinutes)`. A split leaf runs its chunk loop to exhaustion with every chunk placed after the previous leaf's end, and the **next** leaf chains after the last chunk — the split item acts as one dependency link. Always returns `permanentFailure: false` — the retry loop handles `NO_SLOTS`.

### Split tasks (chunked placement)

A task (or goal leaf) with non-null `Planner.splitting` (`{minMinutes, maxMinutes, maxMinutesPerDay?, minSpacingMinutes?}`, parsed by [utils/taskSplitting.ts](../utils/taskSplitting.ts)) is placed as dynamically sized chunks by [scheduleSplitTask](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/scheduleSplitTask.ts):

- **Chunk loop.** While minutes remain, run the 5-phase pipeline with a `ChunkSizing`: fit-test at the required minimum, then `grantChunkMinutes` decides the reserved size from the selected slot's real headroom, capped by `maxMinutes` and the remaining day budget. Each chunk rides the pipeline as a synthetic planner clone whose id is the chunk event id (`` `${plannerId}|chunk:${n}` ``, ordinal-keyed) — `plannerIdFromEventId` resolves it back to the row, and travel/buffer handling applies per chunk like any other dynamic placement. The clone's location/category map entries are copied from the parent row so the chunk doesn't silently default to "Anywhere"/uncategorized.
- **Carving invariant.** The leftover remainder is always zero or ≥ `minMinutes`. A remainder under `2*min` cannot be split, so the only valid chunk is the whole remainder — rule-forced (not slot-driven), applies even in strict mode, may exceed `maxMinutes`, and is recorded as a `maxChunk` relaxation.
- **Per-day cap.** `maxMinutesPerDay` maintains a per-task per-day ledger (seeded from the row's completed segments, so today's finished work counts). The `ChunkSizing.dayBudget` seam makes `selectBestSlot` skip slots on exhausted days. The cap is only relaxed by the final compromise pass (`dayCap` relaxation).
- **Spacing.** `minSpacingMinutes` (optional) holds the next chunk until at least that long after the previous chunk's end — anchor seeded from the latest completed segment too. Default none: chunks sit only the standard placement buffer apart.
- **Composition with a goal cap.** When the leaf sits under a goal with a daily cap, the effective day budget is the pointwise min of the task's own budget and the goal's, and every placed chunk charges both ledgers. A goal budget below the required minimum chunk is rule-forced out of the composition (no day could ever host the chunk under it) and recorded as an `oversizedLeaf` goal relaxation.
- **Failure shape.** A chunk that finds no slot returns `fullyPlaced: false` with the placed chunks kept — the outer loop retries the remainder after expansion.

Chunk events are never memoized ([Phase 2](#phase-2--build-initial-event-array)); completed minutes are always derived by summing `completedSegments`. Guarded by [`split-task-scheduling.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/split-task-scheduling.test.ts).

### Goal daily cap

A goal root with non-null `Planner.maxMinutesPerDay` has its whole subtree metered against one per-day ledger ([goalDayCap.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/goalDayCap.ts)) — the split-task day cap one level up, riding the same `ChunkSizing.dayBudget` seam:

- **Seeding.** `seedGoalDayLedger` runs once per goal per run, charging pre-existing subtree events — completed leaves, completed split segments, memoized past events — all of which sit in `context.scheduledEvents` before any dynamic placement, so one scan covers today's history.
- **Plain leaves** place through `wholeBlockSizing`: a fixed grant that returns the full duration when both headroom and day budget allow it, else 0 — the block places whole on a day with room or tries another day; the grant never shrinks it.
- **Split leaves** compose the goal budget with their own per-task budget (pointwise min), charging both ledgers per chunk.
- **Two-tier relaxation.** Scarcity stays strict through horizon expansion and is only relaxed by the final compromise pass (`dayCap`). But a block that can NEVER fit under the cap — leaf duration or minimum chunk > cap — places whole immediately (`oversizedLeaf`); no expansion creates such a day, and holding it strict would starve the loop.
- Budget tests key on the slot's **start** day; a midnight-crossing placement charges each day it touches (split-task parity, via `addIntervalMinutesByDay`).

Only root goal candidates reach `scheduleGoal`, so a stale cap on a retyped or nested row is inert. Guarded by [`goal-day-cap.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/goal-day-cap.test.ts).

## 7. The Static Travel Pass

[helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/) is the state machine that places travel between consecutive non-matching locations across the slot array. It runs once after the initial slot build (`preliminary` pass) and again at the seam after every [expandSlots](#8-incremental-horizon-expansion) call.

### The walk

[staticEventTravelPass.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/staticEventTravelPass.ts) walks the slot array in order with a `while` loop. Handlers return the next index to process, so newly-spliced slots aren't re-processed. Occupied and Travel slots are skipped; Available slots go to [handleAvailable](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/handleAvailable.ts); Category slots go to [handleCategory](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/handleCategory.ts).

### Round-trip detection (`legTracker`)

[legTracker.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/legTracker.ts) maintains an ordered list of open outbound legs. `track(from, to)` returns:

- **`true`** when the trip closes an open leg (return trip — strict mirror match, or chained-return where `X → A` closes the chain starting at `A`).
- **`false`** when it opens a new leg.

`untrack(from, to)` rewinds a previously opened leg, used by absorb cascades when the dispatcher undoes a placed travel before replanning. Whether `track` returns true or false changes whether the new travel lands at slot-start (return — get back early) or slot-end (outbound — leave at last possible moment) in `handleAvailable`.

`TravelManager.resolveTravel(slot)` and `resolveCategoryEdge(slot, edge)` are the entry points; both call `legTracker.track` internally but only `resolveTravel` uses the return value for placement direction. For category edges, placement is fixed by the edge — `track` is called for round-trip bookkeeping only.

### Handler decisions

**`handleAvailable`** (transitions during free time):

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| prev === next (no transition) | skip |
| Travel fits in current slot | `placeTravelInCurrent` (start or end per `placeAtSlotStart`) |
| Too small, prev is Travel | `absorbAndReplan` — undo prior travel, merge with current, replan single longer travel at the tail |
| Too small, prev soft + next soft | `bleedAcrossPrevCurrentNext` |
| Too small, prev soft + next hard | `bleedIntoPrev` |
| Too small, prev hard + next soft | `bleedIntoNext` |
| Too small, prev hard + next hard | `fillCurrentWithAlert` (insufficient travel) |

**`handleCategory`** processes two edges per category slot.

- **Entry edge**: if `isFinal` is set, skip — entry was placed during the earlier pass; only the exit edge re-runs at the seam. Otherwise place entry travel at the head; if the slot is too small, `bypassCategoryCascade` walks forward to find a landing point.
- **Exit edge**: if no next slot exists, defer (set `isFinal` for expansion). If the next slot is Available, defer (the Available handler will pick it up). If the next slot is another Category, attempt symmetric-bleed splitting travel across both categories; on failure try backward absorb (`absorbAndReplanIntoNextCategory`), then forward cascade. If the next slot is Occupied, place at tail; if too small, try backward absorb through the category (`absorbAndReplanThroughCategory`) or trespass.

### Absorb / Bleed / Cascade

These are the three space-recovery strategies the handlers reach for when a single slot can't hold the travel.

- **absorb** ([absorb.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/absorb.ts)) — Roll a previously placed travel and the current slot into a single absorb region, untrack the original leg(s) via `legTracker.untrack`, and replan one longer travel covering the merged region. Handles insufficient travel by extending into the next slot's head.
- **bleed** ([bleed.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/bleed.ts)) — Place travel in current, then steal overflow time from soft (Available / Category) neighbors. Cascades when overflow exceeds a single neighbor. Trespass is marked only on **full interior consumption** — a partial bleed shortens the category without marking a boundary.
- **cascade** ([cascade.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/cascade.ts)) — Forward or backward geometric walk to find a landing-spot Category or pinned location. Forward cascade is used when a category entry can't fit (walk past categories until a natural landing). Backward cascade is used for overconstrained category-to-category exits.

### Static-pass invariants (memory-encoded)

These are user-encoded invariants the static pass must respect; check them when modifying handler logic:

- **Overconstrained boundaries must align to original-fabric seams.** The shard model preserves original source boundaries via `originalSourceStart` / `originalSourceEnd`; cascade output should fall on those edges, not invented mid-interval boundaries.
- **Cascade absorbs fill the region with no leading Available.** A cascade-absorbed range becomes a contiguous travel span. Contrast bleed-recovery, which preserves "at origin" Available time where the user genuinely had a window.
- **Restore bleed-trimmed prev category to wrapper.** When a bleed shortens a category, the wrapper is reconstructed via [buildLandingSurvivor](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/staticEventTravelPass/slotShape.ts) so the renderer sees the full original category.
- **Jump intermediate category as 0-min overconstrained travel when surrounding categories share a location.** [dropUnreachableCategoryVisits](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/dropUnreachableCategoryVisits.ts) pre-pass replaces an unreachable middle category with a zero-minute `overconstrained` travel at the surrounding location.

### Trespass marking

Trespass flags (`trespassingStart` / `trespassingEnd`) on `CategorySlot` indicate travel-into / travel-out-of that category would have fully consumed its interior. They are set during placement, cleared at the end of each iteration if the marker now sits strictly inside a Travel slot interior (the visible travel already conveys the crossing). Downstream, [stampCategoryEventBorders](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/EventAssembler/stampCategoryEventBorders.ts) reads these flags and stamps them onto the persisted `CategoryEvent` rows so the renderer can draw red borders without re-running the engine.

### The `isFinal` pickup marker

The last action of every static pass is to mark the last category whose exit edge was deferred (because there was no next slot to place toward) with `isFinal: true`. The pass guarantees at most one slot in the array carries this flag at a time. The marker is the pickup point for the next `expandSlots` call.

---

## 8. Incremental Horizon Expansion

The slot horizon is bounded — initial build covers `HORIZON_CHUNK_DAYS = 28` days regardless of how far out the user has Plans. When the scheduler exhausts slots, [expandSlots](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/expandSlots.ts) appends another chunk.

### The mechanism

1. **Find the pickup point.** Search for the slot with `isFinal === true` (set by the previous static pass). Pickup time = `isFinal.end`. The marker can only live on a `CategorySlot`, so a fabric with no category slots (no windowed categories, or every window occurrence covered by fixed events) legitimately has none — pickup then falls back to the start of today, nothing is preserved, and the whole region rebuilds (safe: a marker-less fabric holds no committed category-edge decisions).
2. **Compute chunk bounds.** `chunkEnd = endOfDay(chunkBase + HORIZON_CHUNK_DAYS - 1)`, where `chunkBase` is the pickup time when a marker exists (it sits near the horizon tail) but the **current horizon end** (`deriveSchedulingHorizon`) when it doesn't — growing from the fallback pickup (today) would rebuild the same chunk forever, burning the expansion budget on no-ops and failing `NO_SLOTS` on anything that needed room past the initial chunk (guarded by [`expansion-without-categories.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/expansion-without-categories.test.ts)).
3. **Split the slot array.** Everything ending ≤ `pickupTime` is preserved verbatim (`preservedSlots`); everything after is discarded. The static pass's decisions on preserved slots are retained — they are not re-processed.
4. **Compute `startingLocationOverride`.** From the last preserved slot's outgoing location, so the freshly-built region's seam Available starts with an honest `prev`.
5. **Rebuild the new region.** Call `buildAvailableSlots({ startDate: pickupTime, ..., startingLocationOverride })` over the new chunk window.
6. **Combine and sort.** `[...preservedSlots, ...newSlots]`.
7. **Replay `legTracker` state.** Reset the tracker, then walk preserved Travel slots and call `legTracker.track(from, to)` once per **unique** `travelId` (skipping self-travels where `from === to`). This restores round-trip detection state so the seam re-decision behaves correctly.
8. **Resume the static pass.** Call `staticEventTravelPass` with `resumeIdx = index of isFinal slot in combined array` (or `0` if no marker existed). The pass picks up at exactly the deferred exit edge and proceeds across the new region. On completion it marks a fresh `isFinal` on the new last-deferred category.

### Why the tail buffer

`PLACEMENT_BUFFER_DAYS = 3` of trailing horizon room is left empty — `findAllFittingSlots` filters out slots starting past `lastPlaceableSlotEnd − PLACEMENT_BUFFER_DAYS`. This gives the next expansion's static-pass resume **empty room** to re-decide travel placement at the seam without colliding with already-placed dynamic events.

### Why proactive expansion matters

Without the proactive watermark check, the scheduler would burn iterations on tasks that can't possibly fit before triggering reactive expansion. Detecting "biggest candidate > biggest compatible slot" before the forward pass starts cuts straight to the expansion step. The comparison must use `effectiveCandidateDuration` (goals sized as their largest uncompleted leaf, excluding leaves already placed or memoized) — see Section 6 for the starvation failure mode when the goal aggregate is used instead. The watermark must also resolve category constraints against the same window-bearing category set placement uses (`scheduledCategories`): a classification-only category (no time windows) is unconstrained at placement, and treating it as constraining here demands category slots that can never exist — the loop then spends its whole expansion budget on watermark `continue`s and the placement walk never runs.

### Regression coverage

These tests live in [`__tests__/calendar-generation/`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/) (the full engine-test index is in CLAUDE.md's Tests section):

- [`expansion-seam.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/expansion-seam.test.ts) — guards the `CategoryEvent` ID format (`` `${categoryTimeWindowId}|${YYYY-MM-DD-local}` ``) by running `generateCalendar` with a single Plan three weeks out (which forces expansion) and asserting that every produced `CategoryEvent` ID matches the local-date pattern. The diff layer and the DB schema depend on this composite ID; a regression to UTC-instant keying would diverge near midnight UTC and would be caught here.
- [`ready-goal-watermark.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/ready-goal-watermark.test.ts) — guards the three watermark starvation modes: a ready root goal must place every leaf even when the subtree aggregate exceeds any slot, when its `categoryId` names a windowless (classification-only) category, and when a memoized past leaf would otherwise inflate the goal's effective size.
- [`ready-gate.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/ready-gate.test.ts) — guards the Phase 9 readiness gate as the universal scheduling gate: a NOT-ready goal's subtree schedules nothing, a ready standalone task places, and a NOT-ready standalone task does not.
- [`completed-task-not-rescheduled.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/completed-task-not-rescheduled.test.ts) — guards the Phase 9 completed-task filter: a completed task under a ready goal renders exactly once, at its completion window, and never re-enters the scheduler.
- [`category-window-recurrence-exceptions.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/category-window-recurrence-exceptions.test.ts) — guards `expandCategoryWindowPeriods`: deleted occurrences vacate both the CategoryEvents and the slot fabric, moved occurrences keep their original-date id while relocating placement, and a move across the horizon seam emits exactly once (containing-range rule). The seam case leaves one window fragment uncovered so the marker-based pickup path is the one exercised.
- [`expansion-without-categories.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/expansion-without-categories.test.ts) — guards the marker-less growth path: with zero CategorySlots there is nothing for `markLastCategoryAsFinal` to stamp, so the chunk base must derive from the current horizon end rather than the fallback pickup (today) — otherwise expansion rebuilds the same chunk forever and an overflow task fails `NO_SLOTS` instead of placing past day 28.

All but the seam, window-exception, and marker-less-expansion tests run against a trimmed live-data snapshot in `fixtures/` — hand-built minimal fixtures rarely produce a valid slot fabric and fail silently, so new full-pipeline tests should extend the fixture pattern. Deliberate exceptions exist where the test's specific geometry demands hand-built inputs (the seam/window/cascade tests plus [`split-task-scheduling.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/split-task-scheduling.test.ts), [`goal-day-cap.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/goal-day-cap.test.ts), and [`scheduling-constraints.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/scheduling-constraints.test.ts)); the full engine-test index lives in CLAUDE.md's Tests section.

## 9. Capacity Gating & Placement Buffer

### `maxEffectiveCapacityFor`

[capacityCheck.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/capacityCheck.ts) computes the largest single duration a task could ever fit in a **clean week** (i.e. before any other tasks consume slots), accounting for:

1. **Template gaps** — `gapIntervalsForDay` produces each day's free intervals (between templates).
2. **Strict-category subtraction** — strict categories the task is **not** eligible for (not in its window-cascade set) subtract from any gap they overlap (the task can never use them).
3. **Per-category ceiling** — if the task is window-constrained, the largest window across all categories it is eligible for (own + non-confined ancestors) is a hard ceiling.

Returns `min(categoryCeiling, largestGap)`. Cached per `taskCategoryId ?? "anywhere"` for the duration of a scheduling pass.

`scheduleSingleTask` and `scheduleGoal` call this at task entry and take the min with the task's allowed-times ceiling (`maxAllowedBlockMinutes` — the exact longest contiguous block a generic week offers under the constraint chain, measured on a two-week unroll so blocks chaining across midnight and the week seam count; the per-task value stays outside the category-keyed cache). If the required block exceeds `maxCapacity`, the task is marked `TOO_LARGE` immediately — no iterations wasted attempting placement, and no expansion budget burned hunting for an allowed block that cannot exist. The required block is the full duration for a plain task, but only the required **minimum chunk** for a split task (`minChunkRequired` of the run's remainder) — a split task is `TOO_LARGE` only when not even one minimum chunk fits anywhere.

### `largestCompatibleSlotForLargestTask`

Same module, used by the proactive expansion check. Walks the slot array and returns the largest currently-existing slot the caller-supplied biggest remaining candidate could land in, honoring category strictness and the `placementCutoffDate`. The biggest candidate is selected once per outer-loop iteration in `scheduleTasksAndGoals` by `effectiveCandidateDuration` (same module) and shared with the watermark comparison: a task's own duration, but a goal's **largest uncompleted, still-placeable leaf** — never the subtree aggregate (see Section 6), and never a leaf that is memoized or already placed this run. Split items (standalone or leaf) size as their required **minimum chunk** (`placementBlockMinutes`), never the full remainder — the aggregate would pin the watermark exactly like the goal aggregate did. Category eligibility is resolved through `categoryEligibilityMap` and intersected with the caller-supplied `schedulableCategoryIds` (the window-bearing categories), so the watermark agrees with `findValidSlots` about which windows a subcategory item may cascade into.

## 10. Strategies

[helpers/Scheduler/selectBestSlot.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/selectBestSlot.ts) scores slots via a single composite strategy.

### The interface

```typescript
interface SchedulingStrategy {
  readonly name: string;
  score(task: Planner, slot: PlaceableSlot, context: SchedulingContext): number; // 0.0–1.0
}
```

`PlaceableSlot = AvailableSlot | CategorySlot` — strategies never score Occupied or Travel slots.

### `CompositeStrategy`

[SchedulingStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/strategies/SchedulingStrategy.ts) holds an array of `{ strategy, weight }` pairs. `score` returns the weighted mean. `getDetailedScores` returns per-strategy raw values for debugging.

### Built-in strategies

- **`EarliestSlotStrategy`** ([EarliestSlotStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/strategies/EarliestSlotStrategy.ts)) — Linear decay: `score = max(0, 1 - daysFromNow / 14)`. Task-independent. Day 0 → 1.0, Day 14+ → 0.0.
- **`LocationGroupingStrategy`** ([LocationGroupingStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/strategies/LocationGroupingStrategy.ts)) — Examines the slot's `prevLocationId` / `nextLocationId` (or `currentLocationId` for `CategorySlot`) and applies a base sandwich-match score plus a travel-time penalty when locations don't match.

### Default constants (verbatim from [strategies/defaultStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/strategies/defaultStrategy.ts))

```typescript
DEFAULT_STRATEGY_WEIGHTS = {
  earliestSlot:     1.0,
  locationGrouping: 0.2,
};

DEFAULT_LOCATION_GROUPING_SCORES = {
  bothMatch:       0.95,  // both adjacent events match task location (sandwich)
  oneMatchOneOpen: 0.8,   // one end matches, other is open (start/end of day)
  oneMatch:        0.5,   // one end matches, other doesn't
  bothOpen:        0.7,   // both ends open (empty day)
  oneOpenNoMatch:  0.45,  // one end open, other doesn't match
  neitherMatch:    0.4,   // neither adjacent event matches
  noLocation:      0.5,   // task has no location (neutral)
};

DEFAULT_LOCATION_GROUPING_PENALTIES = {
  maxSingleTravelPenalty:     0.02,
  maxDoubleTravelPenalty:     0.03,
  singleTravelPenaltyDivisor: 600,   // penalty = travelMinutes / 600 (capped)
  doubleTravelPenaltyDivisor: 400,
};
```

### Strategy assembly

[buildSchedulingStrategy.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildSchedulingStrategy.ts) always includes `EarliestSlotStrategy`. `LocationGroupingStrategy` is added only if a `travelTimeMatrix` was supplied. Weights default to `DEFAULT_STRATEGY_WEIGHTS` but can be overridden per call.

## 11. The Shard Model & Identity-Based Absorb/Reclaim

[utils/timeSlotUtils.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/utils/timeSlotUtils.ts) implements the engine's identity-based travel manipulation.

### Why shards exist

A single logical travel can span multiple source slots (a bleed across prev-current-next produces three pieces — one per eaten source). Fusing them into a single `TravelSlot` would erase the original source identities, breaking restoration when the travel is later absorbed or reclaimed. Instead, each piece is emitted as its own `TravelSlot` shard sharing a common `travelId` (UUID).

### Shard fields

Each shard carries:

- **`travelId`** — UUID shared by all shards of one logical travel.
- **`originalType`** — `"available"` or `"category"` — the source kind.
- **`originalSourceStart`** / **`originalSourceEnd`** — the original fragment's boundaries before splicing.
- For category shards: **`originalCategoryId`**, **`originalLocationId`**, **`originalIsStrictCategory`**.
- For available shards: **`originalPrevLocationId`**, **`originalNextLocationId`**.

### Core operations

- **`createTravelShards(sources, ...)`** — given source fragments, produce N `TravelSlot`s with a shared `travelId` and the appropriate `original*` fields.
- **`collectShardSources(absorbedRange)`** — extract `ShardSource`s from an absorbed range, clipped to the absorb boundary; chained absorbs inherit `originalType` from existing shards.
- **`unplanTravel(slots, travelId)`** — remove all shards of a `travelId` and restore source fragments via `restoreShardSource`; adjacent restored siblings (Available↔Available, Category↔Category with same category/location) are merged.
- **`restoreAbsorbedRange(slots, start, end)`** — reconstruct Available/Category fragments inside `[start, end]`, recursively unpacking any travel shards there to their original sources. Used by `reserveSlotWithTravel` after splicing a placement into an absorbed region.
- **`reclaimTravelSlot(slot)`** — convert a `TravelSlot` back to a `PlaceableSlot` of the original kind (CategorySlot if `originalType === "category"`, else AvailableSlot).
- **`TravelShardSpan`** — `{ travelId, spanStart, spanEnd, shardIndices }`. Returned by `findAdjacentTravel*` and `findPrecedingGapTravel`; carries everything `reserveSlotWithTravel` needs to remove the span by identity.
- **`removeTravelSpanByTravelId` / `removeTravelSpanAt`** — safe multi-shard removal.

### Why identity-based removal matters

Earlier versions of the engine searched for adjacent travel by time-window heuristics. That broke when multi-shard travels straddled the heuristic boundary, when buffer offsets shifted positions, or when two unrelated travels happened to fall near the same time. Identity removal (carry the `TravelShardSpan` through `SlotSelectionResult`, remove all shards of that `travelId` in `reserveSlotWithTravel`) eliminates the entire class of false-positive removals.

The same pattern applies to inbound/outbound travel removal in the dynamic path: pre-existing travels are matched by exact end-position (`occ.end === task.start` for inbound, `occ.end === slot.end` for outbound) rather than by tolerance window.

## 12. Category System

A `Category` is a hierarchical organizational container with four engine-relevant attributes:

- **`timeSlots: CategoryTimeWindow[]`** — `[{ day, startTime, endTime, ... }]`. Day uses ISO weekday numbers (`0 = Sunday`, `1 = Monday`, ...).
- **`isStrict: boolean`** — if `true`, only items that are **members** of this category can be scheduled in its windows. Other items are filtered out by `findAllFittingSlots` and by `maxEffectiveCapacityFor`'s strict-category subtraction. Membership is hierarchical (see below), so a strict `work` window still admits a `project` item.
- **`confineToOwnWindows: boolean`** — if `true`, this category's items schedule only in its own windows (no upward cascade), and it caps any descendant climbing the chain. Default `false`.
- **`locationId: string | null`** — default location for items inside the category that don't carry one explicitly. Inherited via `LocationMapper` as the third fallback (after own location and parent chain).

A category only contributes to scheduling geometry if `useTimeWindows === true` **and** `timeSlots.length > 0` (filtered in `CalendarGenerator`'s constructor). Categories that fail either check still contribute location inheritance.

### Hierarchical membership (window cascade)

An item is a member of its effective category **and every ancestor**, so a `project` (nested under `work`) item may occupy a `work` window — but a plain `work` item never lands in a `project` window (descendant, not ancestor). [buildCategoryEligibilityMap](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/CalendarGenerator/buildCategoryEligibilityMap.ts) (Phase 4) computes, once per pass from the full category list, `categoryId → Set<eligible categoryId>` — the category itself plus non-confined ancestors, climbing until (and including) the first `confineToOwnWindows` ceiling or the root. It rides in `SchedulingContext.categoryEligibilityMap`.

The three match sites test set membership instead of id equality:

- `findAllFittingSlots` / `findValidSlots` — a window-constrained task (its eligible set intersects the window-bearing categories) only accepts category slots whose `categoryId` is in the eligible set; otherwise it's unconstrained (Available + non-strict) exactly as before.
- `maxEffectiveCapacityFor` — the per-category ceiling is the largest window across all eligible window-categories, and strict-category subtraction skips any strict category the task is eligible for.
- `largestCompatibleSlotForLargestTask` — the proactive-expansion watermark mirrors the same eligible-set predicate.

### Materialization

Each generation, `buildCategoryEvents` materializes one `CategoryEvent` row per `CategoryTimeWindow` per matching local day across the horizon, expanding through `expandCategoryWindowPeriods` (per-occurrence exceptions applied — deleted occurrences produce no row, moved ones carry the override in `start`/`end`). IDs are composite (`` `${windowId}|${YYYY-MM-DD-local}` ``), keyed on the **local** calendar date of the ORIGINAL rule-derived occurrence — not the UTC instant, and not the override date — so day boundaries near midnight UTC don't desync the diff layer and a moved occurrence keeps its identity. `stampCategoryEventBorders` propagates trespass flags from category slots and insufficient-travel slots onto these rows (containment-based, so moved occurrences stamp correctly).

## 13. Debugging the Engine

The engine has a built-in switchboard at [calendarGeneration.ts:98–114](../utils/calendar-generation/calendarGeneration.ts#L98-L114). Set `enableLogging = true` and flip individual flags:

| Flag | What it dumps |
| --- | --- |
| `metrics` | Final `SchedulingMetrics` |
| `failures` | All `SchedulingFailure` rows |
| `finalEvents` | The final `SimpleEvent[]` |
| `leanCalendar` | Sorted output events with title / start / end / location — the most readable single dump |
| `travelDebug` | Travel pass diagnostics |
| `templateInfo` | Template expansion stats |
| `planners` / `templates` / `locations` | Echo of input |
| `strategySettings` | Active strategy weights / scores / penalties |
| `staticEventTravelPass` | Per-slot decision/action trail of every static pass (preliminary plus each `resume@<date>` expansion) — set via [TravelPassRecorder](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/TravelPassRecorder.ts), formatted via [travelPassMessages](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/TravelManager/travelPassMessages.ts) |
| `dynamicScheduling` | Per-task decision/action trail of every dynamic placement — set via [SchedulerRecorder](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/SchedulerRecorder.ts), formatted via [schedulerMessages](../utils/calendar-generation/helpers/Scheduler/schedulerMessages.ts). A `COMPACT` constant in [loggingUtils.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/utils/loggingUtils.ts) (default `true`) prints only task headers + outcomes — one screenful per regen instead of a slot-dump avalanche; flip it off for the full decision/action/end-state trail on a task under investigation |
| `dateRangeStart` / `dateRangeEnd` | Inclusive bounds applied to event-based dumps (`finalEvents`, `leanCalendar`, `travelDebug`) and the recorder trails. Either can be `null` to leave that side open. |

When investigating a misplaced travel block or a task that ended up in the wrong slot:

1. Set `enableLogging = true`.
2. Enable `leanCalendar` to confirm the symptom.
3. Enable `staticEventTravelPass` (for travel placement bugs) or `dynamicScheduling` (for task placement bugs).
4. Use `dateRangeStart` / `dateRangeEnd` to narrow output to the affected day or two.
5. Read the trail. Each recorder entry includes the decision branching, actions taken, and an end-state snapshot of the relevant slots.

[RecorderBase.ts](../utils/calendar-generation/utils/RecorderBase.ts) provides shared formatting (date stamps, slot labels, marker decoration); both recorders extend it.

## 14. Engine-Internal Utilities

[utils/](../utils/calendar-generation/utils/):

- **`dateTimeService.ts`** — centralized date helpers (week boundaries, day comparison, minute math, ISO parse/format, range overlap, day-key generation). **The engine should not call `date-fns` directly outside this file.**
- **`intervalUtils.ts`** — `findGaps` (Occupied intervals → Available slots with `prev`/`next` location), `eventsToIntervals`, `masksToIntervals`, `mergeIntervals`, `findLocationTransitions`, `detectTrespassingEvents`. `masksToIntervals` applies per-occurrence template exceptions (`PerTemplateMask.recurrenceExceptions`, from `EventTemplate.recurrenceExceptions`): for each matching day it computes the occurrence key and skips a `deleted` occurrence or re-times a `moved` one (same duration). This is the single place template time enters the slot fabric — the SimpleEvents from `expandTemplates` are filtered out of both the slot build and final `events`. The "clean week" capacity heuristics (`gapIntervalsForDay`, `calculateLargestGap`) stay exception-unaware by design — they model the typical week's ceiling, which a one-off move/skip shouldn't move.
- **`loggingUtils.ts`** — `logCalendarDebugInfo` dispatcher and `filterEventsByLogRange` (open-bounded filter — `null` on either side leaves it open).
- **`RecorderBase.ts`** — base class for `TravelPassRecorder` + `SchedulerRecorder`.
- **`timeSlotUtils.ts`** — the shard model (Section 11). Also `getDurationMinutes`, `canFitDuration`, `doSlotsOverlap`, `splitSlot`, `occupySlot`, `createTravelSlot`, `isTravelSlot`.

## 16. Key Gotchas & Edge Cases

- **The slot array is the truth.** Never compute placement from a separate "free time" cache. Always read from `TimeSlotManager.slots` after each splice.
- **Travel is shards, not slots.** When manipulating a logical travel, work via `travelId`. Don't search adjacent slots by time window — use `findAdjacentTravel*` / `findPrecedingGapTravel`, which return `TravelShardSpan` and let `reserveSlotWithTravel` remove by identity.
- **Buffer is owned by the unit, not the slot.** Each dynamic placement owns its own leading + trailing buffer. Travel sits flush against the task; the buffer is outside the `[travel-before, task, travel-after]` unit on both sides.
- **Standalone-before changes leading buffer ownership.** When travel-before fits in an earlier slot, the leading buffer is owned by that earlier slot — the task lands flush at `slot.start` in the current slot.
- **`null` locationId means "Anywhere", not "missing".** Travel propagates through Anywhere events instead of ending at them. Strategy scoring and travel placement honor this.
- **`isFinal` is a single-instance marker.** At most one slot carries it. If you see two, something is wrong.
- **`legTracker` must be replayed at the seam.** Without replay, round-trip detection in the expanded region treats every leg as new outbound. Replay deduplicates multi-shard travels by `travelId` and skips self-travels.
- **Category membership is hierarchical.** An item is a member of its effective category and every non-confined ancestor (see [Section 12](#12-category-system)). Match sites test the eligible-set (`categoryEligibilityMap`), not id equality — a `project` item may occupy a `work` window, a `work` item may not occupy a `project` window, and `confineToOwnWindows` opts a subcategory out of the cascade.
- **Strict category subtraction in `maxEffectiveCapacityFor`.** A strict category the task is **not eligible for** blocks the entire window it overlaps, even if the window has free interior. The capacity check must subtract these; strict categories the task *is* eligible for (an ancestor it cascades into) are not subtracted.
- **Per-category ceiling.** A window-constrained task can never exceed the largest window across the categories it is eligible for, regardless of template gaps.
- **`placementCutoffDate` suppresses dynamic placement in the tail.** Don't try to "use the whole horizon" — leave the last `PLACEMENT_BUFFER_DAYS` empty so the next seam re-decision has room.
- **`useTimeWindows + timeSlots.length > 0` is the scheduling gate.** A category missing either still contributes location inheritance but does not constrain slot geometry.
- **CategoryEvent ID is local-date keyed.** `` `${windowId}|${YYYY-MM-DD-local}` ``. Never derive the date component from the UTC instant — the diff layer assumes local. See [`expansion-seam.test.ts`](../__tests__/calendar-generation/expansion-seam.test.ts).
- **Template events are filtered out of `events`.** They're consumed by the slot builder (as `PerTemplateMask[]`), not surfaced in the final `SimpleEvent[]`. The renderer reads recurring template instances separately.
- **Trespass flags propagate from slots to `CategoryEvent` rows.** Don't compute trespass in the renderer — the engine writes it via `stampCategoryEventBorders` so cold loads render correctly.
- **Urgency is not a strategy.** Strategy weights affect *slot scoring* only. Urgency scores are computed once at the top of `CalendarGenerator.execute()` (via `scoreCandidatesAndRootGoals`, which also covers non-candidate root goals so the dashboard can rank them) and consumed by `sortByPriorityAndConstraints` before any strategy runs. The same map is returned as `plannerScores`.
- **Constrained tasks never absorb or reclaim travel.** `selectBestSlot` skips `findAdjacentTravelFrom` / `findPrecedingGapTravel` for any task with an entry in `plannerConstraintsMap` — both back-extend the placement region before the candidate's start, which for a constrained task is clipped to its earliest date / allowed window and must not be crossed. The cost is a slightly less optimal travel layout for constrained tasks; the watermark and capacity heuristics stay constraint-unaware by design (the reactive expansion backstop converges).
- **Chunk events are never memoized.** `buildMemoizedEvents` excludes split planners entirely — an uncompleted past chunk must vanish so its minutes reschedule; the frozen past is the row's `completedSegments`, re-emitted fresh each regen.
- **Day budgets key on the slot's start day, but charges split at midnight.** `ChunkSizing.dayBudget(slotStart)` tests the local day the slot starts on; a midnight-crossing placement charges every day it touches (`addIntervalMinutesByDay`). Keep both sides of that seam consistent when extending cap logic.
- **Day caps are two-tier.** Scarcity (no room left today) stays strict through horizon expansion and only relaxes in the final compromise pass. Impossibility (block or minimum chunk larger than the cap) relaxes immediately — no expansion creates such a day, and staying strict starves the loop.
