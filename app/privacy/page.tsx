          Circadium is a personal scheduling app. It takes your goals, tasks,
          and commitments and produces a placed weekly calendar. This policy
          explains what data we collect, how we use it, and — specifically — how
          we handle data accessed through Google APIs.

          <h2 className={heading}>Who we are</h2>
          <p className={body}>
            The data controller responsible for your personal data is{" "}
            {CONTROLLER_NAME}, based in {CONTROLLER_COUNTRY}. You can reach us
            about any privacy matter at{" "}

          <h2 className={heading}>Data we collect</h2>
          <p className={body}>
            When you use Circadium we store the information you create in the
            app: your tasks, goals, plans, categories, locations, weekly
            templates, and scheduling preferences. To sign you in we store your
            account details (email address and, if you register with a password,
            a securely hashed password). If you sign in with a third-party
            provider such as Google or GitHub, we receive your basic profile
            information from that provider.

          <h2 className={heading}>Google Calendar data</h2>
          <p className={body}>
            If you choose to connect your Google account, Circadium requests
            read-only access to your Google Calendar using the{" "}
            <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly</code> scope.
            We request the narrowest scope that supports the feature: we can
            read your calendar events, and we can never create, edit, or delete
            them.
          </p>
          <p className={body}>We use this access for a single purpose:</p>
          <ul className={list}>
            <li>
              To display your existing Google Calendar events inside Circadium.
            </li>
            <li>
              To treat those events as busy time, so the scheduling engine plans
              your tasks and goals around commitments you already have.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className={body}>
            You can disconnect your Google account at any time from Circadium&apos;s
            settings, which revokes our access and removes the imported event
            data from your account.
          </p>
          <p className={body}>
            Calendar events can sometimes reveal sensitive details (for example,
            a medical appointment). Circadium treats every event purely as busy
            time to schedule around — we do not read into, categorize, or infer
            anything from the content of your events.

          <ul className={list}>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance of a contract</strong> — to provide the
              Circadium service you signed up for: storing your tasks, goals,
              and preferences, and generating your schedule.

              <strong>Consent</strong> — for optional features you switch on,
              such as connecting your Google Calendar or using the AI assistant.
              You can withdraw consent at any time by disconnecting the
              integration or removing the key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — to keep the service
              secure and working, provided this does not override your rights.

          <h2 className={heading}>How your data is stored and protected</h2>
          <p className={body}>
            Your data is stored in a hosted PostgreSQL database and is scoped to
            your account — every request is authenticated and access is limited
            to your own records. Your Anthropic API key, if you use the optional
            AI assistant, never reaches our servers: it is encrypted and stored
            only on your device. Access to Google Calendar data is protected by
            the same account-scoping and is never exposed to other users.

            We do not sell your personal data or your Google user data. We share
            data only with the infrastructure providers (sub-processors) that
            run Circadium, strictly to operate the app and only as required by
            law:

            <li>
              The AI assistant, which is optional and runs on your own API key:
              when you use it, the goals and tasks it works on are sent from your
              browser directly to Anthropic to generate a response.

            transferred outside the EEA, we rely on appropriate safeguards — such
            as the EU&ndash;U.S. Data Privacy Framework or the European

            We keep your data for as long as your account exists. You can delete
            your account from Circadium&apos;s settings at any time; doing so
            permanently removes your data, including any imported Google Calendar
            events. Disconnecting your Google account removes the imported
            calendar data without deleting the rest of your account.
