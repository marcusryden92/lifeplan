# LifePlan

A personal scheduling and task management application that automatically generates optimized calendar schedules from tasks, goals, and recurring templates.

## What It Does

- Define tasks with durations, deadlines, and priorities
- Organize tasks into goals with hierarchical subtask structures
- Set up recurring weekly templates (work blocks, sleep, routines)
- Assign locations to tasks for travel-aware scheduling
- Group tasks into categories with time-based constraints
- Automatically generate a weekly calendar that places everything optimally

The scheduling engine considers task urgency, location proximity, category time windows, and travel time between locations to produce a schedule that minimizes wasted time and respects all constraints.

## Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, TypeScript
- **UI:** shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, FullCalendar
- **State:** Redux Toolkit, React Context
- **Backend:** Next.js Server Actions, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** NextAuth v5

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, OAuth credentials, etc.

# Push schema to database
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push

# Seed with test data (optional)
pnpm prisma db seed

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

## Local Postgres Workflow

```bash
pnpm db:start                  # Spin up Dockerized Postgres
pnpm db:stop                   # Shut it down
pnpm db:seed                   # Run seed script
pnpm prisma:migrate:deploy     # Apply migrations
pnpm db:reset:dev              # Wipe, restart, migrate, and re-seed
pnpm db:studio                 # Open Prisma Studio in browser
```
